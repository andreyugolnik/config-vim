# Vim from Scratch

This repository contains my custom Vim configuration for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The setup is built from scratch and includes only the plugins I actively use in my workflow. I primarily use Vim as a C++ IDE for cross-platform game development.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andreyugolnik/config-vim.git ~/.config/vim
```
